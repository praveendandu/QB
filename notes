disk - partition - filesystem - mount to mount point
commands - fdisk, mkfs, mount, unmount, fsck, df, du
imp files - /proc/filesystems, /proc/mounts, /etc/filesystems, /etc/mtab, /etc/fstab
logical volumes - https://askubuntu.com/questions/3596/what-is-lvm-and-what-is-it-used-for
logical volumes are like dynamic partitions, they can span across multile hard disk devices. 
create/resize/delete LVM "partitions" (they're called "Logical Volumes" in LVM-speak) from the command line while your Linux system is running
======================================================
1. Hit power on button
2. Processor is hardcoded to read from BIOS ROM where BIOS is present
3. BIOS perfroms POST - Power on self test. Test computer hardware insuring hardware is properly functioning.
4. bios to detect, identify and initialize hardware. The bios then goes looking for a boot device. 
   this can be a floppy,hard disk, cdrom, network card or usb drive.
5. BIOS executes mbr. mbr is the first sector on the primary partiotion. mbr contains either boot loader code and code that loads boot loader.
6. boot loader then loads kernel into memory and starts executing it and passes control to it.
7. Kernel starts exuecuting and starts init or systemd daemon process. 
   init reads its config from  /etc/inittab which contains runlevel. use runlevel command to list previous and current run level.
   systemd uses targets instead of run levels. use systemctl get-default to find default target
8. init/systemd based on runlevel/target starts various services/daemons (long runnning background processes).

# Default runlevel. The runlevels used are:
#   0 - halt (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
#   1 - Single user mode
#   2 - Multiuser, without NFS (The same as 3, if you do not have networking)
#   3 - Full multiuser mode
#   4 - unused
#   5 - X11
#   6 - reboot (Do NOT set initdefault to this)

List all targets - systemctl list-units --type=target

# Run level 0 is matched by poweroff.target (and runlevel0.target is a symbolic link to poweroff.target).
# Run level 1 is matched by rescue.target (and runlevel1.target is a symbolic link to rescue.target).
# Run level 3 is emulated by multi-user.target (and runlevel3.target is a symbolic link to multi-user.target).
# Run level 5 is emulated by graphical.target (and runlevel5.target is a symbolic link to graphical.target).
# Run level 6 is emulated by reboot.target (and runlevel6.target is a symbolic link to reboot.target).
# Emergency is matched by emergency.target.

9. For system V services chkconfig --list lists various system services and their runlevel info
   for systemd services  systemctl list-unit-files. Unit file of the service determines in which target a service can be run.
10. Chagne runlevel/target
    init <runlevel>
    systemctl set-default <target>
11. start/stop a service.
    service start name
    systemctl start name
